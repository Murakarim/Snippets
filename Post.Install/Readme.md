# Script post install
## For Ubuntu Mate and Xubuntu

I put the script post.install.sh on the same USB stick live Ubuntu Mate in order to grab online my personal script post install. The script post.install.sh will download and run the scripts post-install-sudo.sh and post-install-user.sh from my Dropbox. I update and edit my scripts -sudo and -user directly in my dropbox, where the script post-install.sh got them. My post install is essential a to do list, a theme for grub when dual boot, set swap, disable apport report, add themes and icons...
