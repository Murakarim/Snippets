### Script to benchmark the system and calculate a single overall score, without prompt the user.
### With Sysbench using CPU, Disk IO & Memory
  ```
./scriptname.sh
Please wait...
CPU..
Disk IO...
Memory...
Done, overall score:
5365478
  ```
The calculation formula can be discussed but it's a real headache.
